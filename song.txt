I said upside down, you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
'Round and 'round, you're turning me

Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round

Instinctively, you give to me the love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully, I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
When no one makes me feel like you do

Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me inside out
And 'round and 'round
